Enjoy three pools, eight tennis courts, and the exquisitely maintained open spaces and walkways throughout the Homestead community. This lot in particular has stunning mountain views from the secluded, private, fenced yard that has gated access (through new Homestead perimeter fencing) to the immense open space behind the home. School bus stops for award-winning Cherry Creek Schools are within steps for those with school-aged children. The home itself is the popular Barrymore floor plan, in which the updated kitchen is open to the family room. Cozy-up in the family room next to the marble, gas-log fireplace while watching the snow fall on the mountains through the large picture window. Enjoy an even larger living space in the main-level formal living room area for those larger gatherings, and serve guests in the adjacent dining room. Upstairs, with new carpet throughout, find a tranquil oasis in the primary bedroom, which boasts a very large storage closet within the eaves - how clever! Three additional large bedrooms (one with possibly the best mountain views in the house) share an updated bathroom with sparkling subway tile and marble floors. The plantation shutters that adorn most windows are a quality upgrade, and the whole-house attic fan can save on utility costs during hot summer months. During those summer months, envision yourself relaxing in your private back yard admiring the flowers and vegetables you have planted in the built-in, wooden, raised garden beds. Then head down to the pool to meet-up with friends and neighbors where the kids also love to congregate. Head to the basement for another bedroom and bathroom, gym area, large storage area, additional crawl space storage, and a spacious laundry room concealed by a quaint farmhouse slider door.",SINGLE_FAMILY,6482 E Costilla Pl,6482 E Costilla Pl,,Centennial,CO,80112,5,1,1,2957,1978,8,999890,,,2025-01-26,685000,2018-04-13,56490,1044000,5613,"[{'year': 2022, 'tax': 5613, 'assessment': {'building': 32095, 'land': 24395, 'total': 56490}}, {'year': 2021, 'tax': 5654, 'assessment': {'building': 33019, 'land': 25097, 'total': 58116}}, {'year': 2020, 'tax': 4911, 'assessment': {'building': 28378, 'land': 21557, 'total': 49935}}, {'year': 2019, 'tax': 4741, 'assessment': {'building': 28378, 'land': 21557, 'total': 49935}}, {'year': 2018, 'tax': 4190, 'assessment': {'building': 28145, 'land': 12960, 'total': 41105}}, {'year': 2017, 'tax': 4429, 'assessment': {'building': 28145, 'land': 12960, 'total': 41105}}, {'year': 2016, 'tax': 3833, 'assessment': {'building': 24835, 'land': 11940, 'total': 36775}}, {'year': 2015, 'tax': 3691, 'assessment': {'building': 24835, 'land': 11940, 'total': 36775}}, {'year': 2014, 'tax': 3179, 'assessment': {'building': 20290, 'land': 8756, 'total': 29046}}, {'year': 2013, 'tax': 3153, 'assessment': {'building': 20290, 'land': 8756, 'total': 29046}}, {'year': 2012, 'tax': 3011, 'assessment': {'building': None, 'land': None, 'total': 27530}}, {'year': 2010, 'tax': 2840, 'assessment': {'building': None, 'land': None, 'total': 27530}}, {'year': 2008, 'tax': 2866, 'assessment': {'building': 21320, 'land': 7160, 'total': 28480}}, {'year': 2007, 'tax': 2781, 'assessment': {'building': 22450, 'land': 6770, 'total': 29220}}]",False,7754,338,39.591786,-104.913938,Homestead in the Willows,Arapahoe,08005,2,137,2,3172106,Kris Wilson,WilsonRealtyColorado@gmail.com,"[{'ext': None, 'primary': True, 'type': 'Mobile', 'number': '7208391663'}]",A-DVCO-29913268,,3616283,Realty One Group Premier -

Featuring an open and timeless functional floorplan with refinished hardwood floors, this home showcases an updated gourmet kitchen featuring stainless steel appliances, double ovens, quartz countertops, gas cooktop and under cabinet lighting. The dine in kitchen overlooks a cozy family room with the original brick fireplace. A main floor office with French doors, dedicated dining room, secondary living room, laundry room and powder bathroom complete the main floor. Step outside to a covered, updated all-weather deck that overlooks the brand new exterior paint and backyard with mature landscaping in the fully fenced yard. Back inside, follow the centerpiece of the home, an updated spiral staircase with refinished wood floors upstairs where you'll find four bedrooms including the large primary suite with an updated five piece bath and large walk in closet. Three additional bedrooms share a full secondary bath with dual sinks. The basement is partially finished with one nonconforming bedroom that is currently used as a gaming room, but could easily function as a second home office, if needed. Other significant updates include a newer roof with Class 4 hail resistant shingles (2023) a newer HVAC system (2019) and Halo water filtration system. Located within the Cherry Creek School district and within close proximity to shopping and parks makes this home an exceptional opportunity!",SINGLE_FAMILY,20954 E Crestline Pl,20954 E Crestline
